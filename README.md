======================


After completing  the tutorial “Web Application Development” from 1 to 10 :

I did simple change on the application. by adding the “Attachment” entity to the “Book” entity. Each book can have multiple Attachments, the attachment entity have the following properties:

Title

Link
 

and I added the simple feature to the “Books” Page.The search feature. By adding search box to the top of the page, the admin can search books by title.
